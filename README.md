# Nick_Patterson
 - 👋 Hi, I’m Nick
 - 👀 I’m interested in systems, processes, and the rules that created them. Boardgames started me down this path as a kid and it has only gotten worse since. I needed to know how they worked, so I read all the manuals that came with a game and tested the rules. Knowing all the rules helped me come up with strategies that would win or break the game. Then I would create additional rules to balance the new strategies and prevent breaking the games. 
 - 🌱 I recently learned how to make wine. I love to drink and compare wine against other wines, constanly challenging my taste profile. Food is a chef's passion on a plate, wine is the winemakers passion in a glass.
 - 💞️ I'd like to collaborate on projects related to Business or financial analysis, that is where most of my domain knowledge lies.
